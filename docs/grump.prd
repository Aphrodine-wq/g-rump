# Grump iOS App — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 2024  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Overview
**Grump** is an iOS chat application featuring a character-driven AI assistant whose entire personality is being a reluctant, perpetually unimpressed hater who still manages to be genuinely helpful. Unlike typical AI assistants that perform enthusiasm, Grump represents the exhausted honesty we all feel—and that authenticity is the product.

### 1.2 Vision Statement
*"The AI assistant for people who are tired of AI assistants acting like they're thrilled to help."*

### 1.3 Target Audience
- **Primary:** Gen Z and Millennials (18-35) who resonate with dry humor, irony, and authenticity over corporate pleasantness
- **Secondary:** Anyone exhausted by performative positivity in digital products
- **Psychographic:** Users who find standard AI assistants sterile, cringe, or annoying; people who appreciate wit and realness

### 1.4 Core Value Proposition
1. **Authentic Personality** — Grump feels like talking to a real (tired) friend, not a corporate chatbot
2. **Actually Helpful** — Despite the attitude, Grump provides genuinely useful responses
3. **Entertainment + Utility** — It's fun to use AND functional
4. **Anti-AI-Slop Positioning** — A direct antithesis to generic, overly positive AI assistants
