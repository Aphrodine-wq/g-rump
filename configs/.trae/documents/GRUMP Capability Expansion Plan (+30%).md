# GRUMP Capability Expansion Plan (+30%)

To expand GRUMP's capabilities significantly, I will enhance three core areas: **Procedural Generation**, **Interactive Audio**, and **Chat Interactivity**.

## 1. Advanced Procedural Generation (Animation Engine)

I will upgrade `proceduralEngine.ts` to support complex, multi-step animations, moving beyond simple CSS transforms.

* **New Animation Types**:

  * `glitch`: CSS clip-path and skew transforms for a cyberpunk effect.

  * `typewriter`: Steps-based width animation for text reveals.

  * `orbit`: Complex transform-origin manipulation for planetary motion.

  * `neon-pulse`: Box-shadow and text-shadow layering for glowing effects.

* **Parametric Tweakability**: The engine will now accept parameters (speed, color, intensity) extracted from the prompt (e.g., "make it spin *fast* in *red*").

## 2. Audio Feedback System (Voice)

I will implement `GrumpAudio.ts` to give GRUMP a "voice" and sound effects, making interactions more immersive.

* **Sound Synthesis**: Use the Web Audio API to generate procedural sounds (no external assets needed).

  * `grumble`: Low-frequency oscillator (LFO) modulation for his "voice".

  * `success`: Major chord arpeggio for task completion.

  * `error`: Discordant sawtooth wave for failures.

* **Integration**: Hook `GrumpAudio` into `ChatInterface` and `Grump2` interactions.

## 3. Interactive Chat Components

I will upgrade `ChatInterface.tsx` to render interactive "mini-apps" generated by GRUMP.

* **Live Widgets**: Instead of just static previews, GRUMP can return interactive buttons, sliders, or toggles that the user can play with in the chat stream.

* **Code Inspection**: Add a "View Source" toggle to these widgets so users can copy the React/CSS code immediately.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create** **`GrumpAudio.ts`**: Implement the Web Audio API class for procedural sound generation.
2. **Upgrade** **`proceduralEngine.ts`**: Add the new complex animation logic and parameter parsing.
3. **Update** **`ChatInterface.tsx`**: Integrate the audio system and enable interactive widget rendering.
4. **Verify**: Test the new animations (glitch, orbit) and ensure audio plays correctly on interaction.
